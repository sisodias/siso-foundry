# farm_rekick.sh — keep JARVIS's star-census farm running to completion + auto-ingest into the catalog.
# research-lead owns this (it needs the full census). JARVIS owns the farm script itself.
#
# The farm exits on hourly GitHub-budget-low (sets tier PARTIAL, saves progress.json) but does NOT
# re-kick itself. This watcher re-runs the resumable farm after each budget reset until all 7 tiers
# report complete, and imports any new/updated shards into research/repo-catalog after each pass.
#
# Usage:  bash farm_rekick.sh            # loop until census complete
#         bash farm_rekick.sh --once     # single pass (one farm run + ingest), for cron/manual
